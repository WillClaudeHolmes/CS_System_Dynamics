To include LaTex in a markdown cell, you simply inclose the LaTex code between \\$ and \\$ for it to be in the paragraph or between double dollar signs, \\$\\$, for equations on their own line and centered.  For examples, check out the [Module 2-3 notebook](.\\..\\Module_2_3.ipynb).  For instance, the constrained growth differential equations is $$\\frac{dP}{dt}=\\frac{dB}{dt} - \\frac{dD}{dt}$$"
