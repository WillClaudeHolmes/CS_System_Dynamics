    "In attempt to raise the concentration of a drug in the system to the minimum effective concentration quickly, sometimes doctors give a patient a loading dose, which is an initial dosage that is much higher than the maintenance dosage. A loading dose for Dilantin is three doses - $400\\:mg$, $300\\:mg$ and $300\\:mg$ two hours apart. Twenty-four hours after the loading dose, normal dosage of $100\\:mg$ every eight hours begins. Develop a model for this dosage regime.  For this problem:\n",
    "-  Develop a computer simulation which models the loading the and regular dosing.\n",
    "-  Plot the results of the model to show drug concentration as a function of time.\n",
    "-  Improve the loading sequence to keep the drug dose between the minimum effective concentration (MEC) and minimum toxic concentration (MTC) given in the text."
