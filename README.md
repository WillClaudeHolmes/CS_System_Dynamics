This learning module accompanies chapter two of Angela B. and George W Shiflet's
book [Introduction to Computational Science](https://ics.wofford-ecs.org/).  In this folder are:
- [Notebook for Module 2-3](Module_2_3.ipynb) which discusses constrained exponential growth and introduces
the concept of carrying capacity.
- [Notebook for Module 2-5](Module_2_5.ipynb) which introduces multicompartment models as well as
system inputs which are impulsive and time varying.
- [Assignment Folder](Assignment.ipynb) which gives the assignments for this chapter.

Note also, that the Module 2-3 notebook contains [discussion of plotting with matplotlib](Module_2_3.ipynb#Note-on-Plotting).
